# MENACE22

The aim of this project is to experiment with reinforcement learning by replicating Donald Michie's 1960 tic-tac-toe mechanical-matchbox-computer player. MENACE, standing for *Matchbox Educable Noughts And. Crosses Engine*, was how he named the project. More info about it can be found [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/idocs/matchbox.pdf).
